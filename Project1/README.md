Battle Patronus

Description:
Battle Patronus is a single player, Harry Potter themed game. The goal of the game is to pick a Patronus and fight your Patronus against a competitor. You are given 3 Health points and 2 lives. By choosing either "Attack" or "Defend" a randon number of Health points are either added or subtracted. When you have 0 health you lose a life until a winner is declared.

Technologies Used:
Battle Patronus is built with HTML/CSS, JQuery, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

Build:
The logic behind the point system for the life and health of the characters was probably the hardest to conceptualize. In the future I would like to increase the actions that players can take beyond the 2 simple attack and defend buttons. I would also like the game to be 2 player in the future.
